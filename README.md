# Advent of Code Challenges

## Introduction

For the longest time, I have wanted to create a repository for AoC challenge code that I write. I am starting from 2015 and documenting all of my coding along the way. 

I am a professional programmer but still very much a beginner at certain topics while being intermediate at others. Hopefully this repository provides insight into different coding practices and topics. Enjoy!
